      Nick arrives at the wedding venue accompanied by the best man / tholan,
      Anurjan (appointed from Pirave’s family), his family and relatives. Upon
      arrival at the wedding hall, Pirave’s family welcomes Nick with a flower
      garland. The best man sprinkles water on Nick’s feet, a gesture lavished
      on an honoured guest, and in return Nick gifts him a gold ring. To the
      accompaniment of the{' '}
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadaswaram">nathaswaram</a> (wind
      instruments) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thavil">thavil</a>{' '}
      (percussion instrument), the best man and Nick’s family lead the groom to
      the altar, where the priest awaits to perform the ceremony.

    <Header>DIVINE PURIFICATION AND PROTECTION</Header>
    <Text>
      Before performing any ceremony, Hindus first and foremost worship{' '}
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganesha">Lord Ganesha</a>, as he is
      the destroyer of all obstacles and hurdles. On the auspicious hour, the
      priest sprinkles holy water sanctifying the ceremonial area. He then
      performs the Ganesha Pooja - a prayer to Lord Ganesha, invoking his
      blessings and protection for the wedding to take place without any
      unforeseen hindrances.
    </Text>
    <Text>
      To enlist divine protection from the unforeseen, the priest conducts
      Puniyathanam by giving Nick a ring of special grass (thetpai as seen on
      the right) on his right ring finger as an indication of purity of mind. He
      also ties on a{' '}
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauli_(thread)">
        holy sacred saffron thread
      </a>{' '}
      around Nick’s right wrist, which serves as a shield from harm and evil to
      anyone who wears it. A male representative from the family breaks a
      coconut. The breaking of coconuts throughout the wedding represents a
      bloodless sacrifice and the destruction of the ego to reveal the purity
      within; the sweet coconut water signifying love, the shedding of
      selfishness. Five married women, symbolizing divine witnesses, from both
      parties are called to sow the nine varieties of traditional grain (<a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ci6wmGIVEAAFoYJ.jpg">
        Navathaaniam
      </a>) in an{' '}
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matki_(earthen_pot)">
        earthen pot
      </a>, to ensure a blessing of fertile life for the couple.

      Pirave now enters the hall accompanied by her family and bridesmaids
      wearing a saree gifted by her sister (Manavarai Saree). She is then
      escorted by her maid of honour / tholi, Elizabeth (a close female
      representative from Nick’s family) and takes her place at the altar to the
      right of Nick. Similar rituals are held to sanctify and protect her;
      however the ring and thread are worn on her left ring finger and left
      wrist respectively. This is because the image of{' '}
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardhanarishvara">
        Arthanareeswarar
      </a>{' '}
      is depicted as half male and half female, split down the middle. The right
      half is the male Shiva, while Parvati is the left half. This symbolises
      the equality of man and woman. When the saffron thread is tied around her
      wrist, a male representative from her family breaks a coconut.

      Next is the Shiva-Parvathi (Shakthi) pooja, symbolizing the enactment of
      the wedding of{' '}
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva">Lord Shiva</a> and{' '}
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parvati">Goddess Parvathi</a> (The
      Thirukalyanam), followed by a pooja to the nine planets (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navagraha">
        Navakiraka
      </a>) invoking the blessings of the nine holy planets. The sacred fire
      (Omum) is now lit invoking the deity{' '}
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agni">Agni</a> (God of Fire) to
      bear witness to the marriage (Agni Saatchi).

    <Header>GIVING AWAY OF THE BRIDE (Kanyaa Thanam)</Header>
    <Text>
      The Kanyaa Thanam ritualis the most sentimental part of the wedding. It is
      where Pirave’s parents give their daughter’s hand in marriage to Nick,
      making Pirave a member of Nick’s family. The priest calls the mothers of
      both Pirave and Nick to the altar who great each other by sprinkling
      scented water and placing yellow{' '}
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilaka">thilakam</a> (turmeric) on
      each other foreheads. Pirave’s mother with betel leaf and coconut in hand
      places her daughter's hand in Nick’s hand indicating that he accept,
      cherish, and protect her all through life. She gives Nick a gold coin
      symbolic of giving away the bride. Nick accepts the coin and in turn gives
      it to his mother. This signifies the acceptance of Pirave by Nick and his
      family.

      The priest blesses the tray, presented to Pirave by Nick, containing the
      matrimonial Koorai saree,{' '}
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangala_sutra">thaali</a> (gold
      necklace symbolising marriage) and other adornments. The tray is presented
      to the guests for their blessing. Pirave then leaves the altar accompanied
      by her mother and tholi (maid of honour) and returns to her bridal suite
      to change into the Koorai saree. The priest consecrates the thaali by
      placing it on a kumbam in which the{' '}
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshmi">Goddess Lakshmi</a>{' '}
      (Goddess of Wealth and Prosperity) is invoked and a pooja seeking her
      blessing is performed. The kumbam is a brass pot of water with a coconut
      and mango leaves placed on it, representing the deity. Pirave then returns
      to the altar with her family and bridesmaids dressed in her Koorai saree
      carrying a garland expressing her consent and acceptance and takes her
      seat next to Nick.

    <Text>
      The crowning moment of the wedding is the thaali ceremony. The thaali is a
      gold pendant with embossed sacred emblems strung on a kodi (a gold chain),
      is a cherished symbol of a married Hindu woman and represents eternal love
      and a pledge to remain faithful in the presence of god. The sacred thaali
      will rest next to her heart. To begin the thaali ceremony, at the very
      auspicious moment (Muhurtham), the priest calls for Kettimelam:{' '}
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thavil">thavil</a> accompanied by{' '}
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadaswaram">nathaswaram</a> rising
      to a crescendo, meant to drown out negative vibrations and other sounds in
      the wedding hall. The priest consecrates the thaali and gives it to Nick,
      who stands to the right of Pirave and ties the thaali around her neck.
      This signifies their union as husband and wife, and is accompanied by
      cutting of a coconut and a shower of flowers as the guest bless the
      couple. With his finger Nick spots Pirave’s forehead with kunkumam
      (vermilion dust), another symbol of a married Hindu woman. The priest
      holds high a lit oil lamp symbolizing the divine light witnessing the
      nuptial knot. The married couple now exchange{' '}
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garland">garlands</a> (mala
      matruthal) three times and Nick moves to accommodate Pirave on his left,
      Shakthi’s place beside Shiva. They also feed each other a mixture of
      fruit, milk, and honey, as a promise of sweet and endless love they hope
      to share.

      Tradition has it that marriage be formalized in the presence of Agni, the
      God of Fire. Here he stands as the universal witness to the union (Agni
      Saatchi). Accompanied by the tholan &amp; tholi, Pirave and Nick will take
      their first steps as husband and wife, circling the sacred fire clockwise
      three times to pay their respect to Agni. Having God as their guide, the
      couple will walk seven steps together to pledge their commitment towards
      the seven goals for spiritual evolution, and this is called Sapatapadi.

      As they go around the Agni certain rituals are performed in keeping with
      tradition. Nick places Pirave’s right foot on a granite stone and puts a
      silver ring (metti) on her second toe. He repeats the same for the left
      foot. In the process the groom blesses her with a will as strong and
      steadfast as the stone to help lead a happy married life with courage and
      faith despite any adversities that may come up in life. The metti also
      indicates marital status of the bride. The priest points to the star
      Arundhathi who was known to be the ideal wife. The priest then drops a
      ring into a pit filled with water for the couple to find the ring. This
      provides for a lighter moment eliciting giggles and chuckles as finger
      play and flounder for the ring in the privacy of the pot. The purpose of
      this ceremony is to also see the understanding of giving in for each
      other. Tradition has it that the one who finds the ring is said to be the
      one who ‘commands’ the family. The couple makes offering to Agni, seeking
      divine blessing (Poorna Ahuthi).

      The priest, the parents, and the guests bless the couple by sprinkling
      them with grains of rice to wish them prosperity and happiness. The
      blessing is completed by the performance of Arthi (alathi) - the circular
      movement of a tray with lighted wicks - by two ladies. A new era dawns in
      the life of the married couple.
